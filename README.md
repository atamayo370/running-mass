# running-mass
Chiral phase transition with running mass for scalar field, based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12525

# Required changes to code:
* Change dilaton everywhere it appears to pure quadratic form from their paper
* Change equations of motion to match theirs (including running mass for scalar field)
* Change test function to match EoMs
